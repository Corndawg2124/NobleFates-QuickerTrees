# NobleFates-QuickerTrees
Trees grow 4x faster. A simple mod that changes the time it takes for full maturation from 24 years to 6 years.
Trees naturally grow half as fast in Fall and Winter, I did not change that.
You can change it fairly easily yourself by opening the .octdat file in a text editor and changing the number to whatever you desire. Just make sure it's still saved as an .octdat when you're done.

Download this as a zip (under the Code option above right). Then unzip it and place the whole thing in your Mods folder: C:\Users\[name]\AppData\LocalLow\Xobermon, LLC\Noble Fates\Mods . You may not have a Mods folder there; if so, add it! (instructions shamelessly stolen from nathanhinchey)

When you're done, it should look like this: C:\Users\[name]\AppData\LocalLow\Xobermon, LLC\Noble Fates\Mods\NobleFates-QuickerTrees-main

Feel free to rename the folder after placing it.
